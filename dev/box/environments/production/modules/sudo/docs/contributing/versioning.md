      <major>.<minor>.<patch>

* `< major >` corresponds to the major version number
* `< minor >` corresponds to the minor version number
* `< patch >` corresponds to the patching version number

Example: `1.2.0`

The current version number is stored in the file `metadata.json`. 
For more information on the version, run:

     $> rake version:info

If a new  version number such be bumped, you simply have to run:

     $> rake version:bump:{major,minor,patch}

This will start the release process for you using `git-flow`.

     $> rake version:release
